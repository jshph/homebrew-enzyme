      🧬 Enzyme installed! Next steps:

      1. Configure MCP for Claude Code:
         claude mcp add enzyme --scope user enzyme-mcp

      2. Configure MCP for Codex (optional):
         Add to ~/.codex/config.toml:

         [mcp_servers.enzyme]
         command = "#{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/enzyme-mcp"
         args = []

      3. Launch Claude Code with Enzyme:
         cd /path/to/your/vault
         claude "/enzyme:enzyme (MCP)"

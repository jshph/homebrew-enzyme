  # Note: Homebrew may show "Failed to fix install linkage" warnings during install.
  # This is expected with PyInstaller-bundled binaries and can be safely ignored.
  # The binaries work correctly - they use @rpath which doesn't need rewriting.

  def install
    # The tarball extracts to the root, install directly to libexec
    libexec.install Dir["*"]

    # Create wrapper scripts that call the binaries
    (bin/"enzyme").write <<~EOS
      #!/bin/bash
      exec "#{libexec}/enzyme" "$@"
    EOS

    (bin/"enzyme-mcp").write <<~EOS

      🧬 Enzyme installed successfully!

      Note: You may have seen "Failed to fix install linkage" warnings above.
      These can be safely ignored - the binaries work correctly.

      Next steps:

      1. Configure MCP for Claude Code:
         claude mcp add enzyme --scope user enzyme-mcp

      2. Configure MCP for Codex (optional):
         Add to ~/.codex/config.toml:

         [mcp_servers.enzyme]
         command = "#{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin/enzyme-mcp"
         args = []

      3. Launch Claude Code with Enzyme:
         cd /path/to/your/vault
         claude "/enzyme:enzyme (MCP)"
